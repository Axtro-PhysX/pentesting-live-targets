# Pen Testing Live Targets

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

# Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description: The SQL command ``' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'`` will invoke an escape and allow the pentester to make the website "sleep" for 5 seconds when inserted into the URL query that pertains to the salesperson ID.

## Green

# Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description: When logging in to the website, we can determine if a username exists within the database by the font shift that occcurs when attempting a login. In this example, the user "jmonroe99" exists within the system and thus the font is bolded. When we insert a username that is seemingly not in the system such as a guessed string of letters and numbers or random word, the unsuccessful attempt is then not bolded thus signifying that the user does not exist within the system.

## Red

# Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Description: Using IDOR, one can inject integers into the URL of salesperson IDs yet again in order to get into pages that are not available within the main menu. when we insert ``11`` and ``10`` we are directed to things like pages of former employees who were fired, which is not supposed to happen when we simply manipulate the URL.
