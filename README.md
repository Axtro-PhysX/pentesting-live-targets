# Pen Testing Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description: When logging in to the website, we can determine if a username exists within the database by the font shift that occcurs when attempting a login. In this example, the user "jmonroe99" exists within the system and thus the font is bolded. When we insert a username that is seemingly not in the system such as a guessed string of letters and numbers or random word, the unsuccessful attempt is then not bolded thus signifying that the user does not exist within the system.
